# ☕ Today’s Glow-Up — Cozy To-Do List App

Welcome to my cozy little productivity tool — built with love, coffee, and a need to romanticize my daily tasks. This is a to-do list app that opens like a desktop notebook, complete with a study gif, coffee mug entry button, and soft brown & beige aesthetics ✨

## 🛠️ How I Built It

This started as a fun mini-project to learn more about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I wanted to take a simple to-do list and give it:

- A **warm aesthetic** (think: journals, lattes, and productivity TikTok)
- A **welcome screen** featuring a `study.gif` background and a clickable ☕ mug to enter
- A **notebook-styled layout** for the main app
- A **progress bar** that fills as you complete tasks — now with a percentage display!
- **Task saving with localStorage**, so your list sticks even when you refresh

I kept the design lightweight and user-friendly. Just click the mug, add your tasks, and enjoy watching your productivity bar grow 🌱
